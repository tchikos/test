Well as you mentioned it's a test to do for technical evolution.
First of all I would like to explain my work to you, the architecture of the project is based on the following parts:
components and issets which contains images and css. On this project I used 7 components to avoid redundant coding, for example component navbar is the menu bar and coded only once and called it when needed and so for others. I used propos on the drawerBar component to avoid coding it too many times and only gave the value as a parameter in the component.
for the css i used the material ui framework.
Otherwise for chart and dynamic array, I didn't understand what you want exactly.
Thank you
